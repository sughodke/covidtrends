## What is this?

This is an [interactive graph / animation]() that charts the trajectory of global COVID-19 cases.

The graph plots the number of new confirmed cases in the past week, versus the total number of confirmed cases.

When plotted in this way, exponential growth is displayed as a straight line.

Notice that most countries follow a similar straight line path, indicating that the growth rate is similar across countries. We're all in this together.

**Tips:** Press Space (or the play button) to Play/Pause. Press +/- keys (or the slider) to see daily changes. Hover over the graph for more info. Drag cursor to zoom into graph, doubleclick to zoom back out. Use dropdown menus to switch between Confirmed Cases ↔ Deaths, or between a logarithmic ↔ linear scale. And don't forget to wash your hands!
